# StarWarsInfo
App showcasing BobaFetcher SDK consumption

The Star Wars Info App consumes a custom built SDK that fetches information about characters, planets and films from SWAPI.

In this project, the SDK was added through SPM and the results of its services incuding search and limit populate a table view that you can play with.

The app was built using only Swift and no external dependencies or SDK's where added.
